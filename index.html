<h2>Nebraska's Finest Cotton Candy</h2>
	<p>We've been the industry leader in cotton candy making for nearly 45 years. Now that's a lot of sugar! We started as a small operation in Nebraska in 1977. Our products are now sold in over 50+ stores including Target, Walmart, Hyvee, and the list goes on and on!</p>

<h3>Why Are We The Best?</h3>
	<p> Because we believe our customers deserve the highest quality and best service possible. That is why we've spent so much time perfecting the art of making cotton candy. We aren't just in the business of making cotton candy. We're in the business of making you smile!</p>
<h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
	<p>We sell boutique packaged cotton candy across the Midwest. We also provide cotton candy machine rentals for weddings and other events. You may see us at your sisters graduation party, or at the local county fair! Either way, we hope we see you soon!</p>
